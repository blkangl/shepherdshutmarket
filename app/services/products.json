Whether blending fibers such as silk, mixed wool, alpaca, bling, Targhee or many other fibers, or spinning Targhee, or demonstrating the craft to school children, spinning has become an absolute necessity for the Shepherd’s Hut Market and my sanity.  What was once hard has become enjoyable.  Now I have the pleasure of making hand spun yarn an important part of what this business is.  Please come in and see the yarn, and see how it is made!",
